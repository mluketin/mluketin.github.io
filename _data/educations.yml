  details: "My task for my Master Thesis at EPFL is to implement WebRTC conferencing in FROG platform.
  FROG is an open-source web-platform to author (design) and run rich collaborative learning activities.
  It introduces a concept of pluggable activity types (like video player, quiz, brainstorming or programming exercises), 
  which can be configured by the designer, and connected in a learning graph, with data from one activity being transformed and reused in another (ideas from a brainstorm flowing into a concept map tool), 
  and with pluggable “operators”, which can transform data, intelligently group students, etc. through the use of algorithms and machine learning.
  While the teacher runs the class, intelligent visualizations show not only simple facts like, for example, how many people have watched a given video,
  but can provide predictions based upon analysis of student actions with the activities. 
  This platform might be used in small classrooms, large lectures or MOOCs."
