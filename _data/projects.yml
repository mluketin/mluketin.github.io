    title: FROG - videochat activity
    link: "https://github.com/chili-epfl/FROG"
    tagline: "FROG is a platform for the collaborative learning. I am working on this project as a part of my Master Thesis.
    My task is to implement video conferencing into this platform. For example: during the lecture, students
    are divided into the smaller groups of 5 to discuss some topics. Each group is offered a few statements and they need to 
    decide whether they agree with a statement or not. 
    By using video chat (video conferencing) instead of the text based chat, students are
    offered better options/possibilities to collaborate and discuss the given statements."
