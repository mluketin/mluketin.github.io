  - project:
    title: FROG - videochat activity
    link: "https://github.com/chili-epfl/FROG"
    tagline: "FROG is a platform for collaborative learning. I am working on this project as part of my Master Thesis.
    My task is to implement video conferencing into this platform. Use case scenario: during the lecture, students
    are grouped into the groups of 5 to discuss some topic. Each group is offered few statements and they need to 
    decide weather they agree with a statement or not. Video chat (video conferencing) is a perfect way to help students 
    to collaborate (instead of having to only use text based chat) and discuss those statements."

  - project:
    title: scalaq
    link: "https://github.com/mluketin/scalaq"
    tagline: "As part of my BSc Thesis, I created library for creating questionnaires (surveys) called scalaq. Library is written in Scala
    and is used in scalaq-demo web application. Idea was to create library that will enable developers to create all kinds of questions for
    their survey applications. (Note: This was my first project in Scala)"
  - project: 
    title: scalaq-demo
    link: "https://github.com/mluketin/scalaq-demo"
    tagline: "Web application written in Scala and Play! framework. Application allows users to create surveys, create links that they
    can send to other users who will complete survey. Users can also download statistics on completed surveys. For database I used postgres,
    and ORM was done with DSL Platform (https://dsl-platform.com/). Exporting statistics into Excel spreadsheet was 
    done with Templater (http://templater.info/).
    (Note: This was my first real web application and first project in Scala. Both scalaq and scalaq-demo are not some
    state-of-the art projects.)"
